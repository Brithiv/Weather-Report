# 🌦️ Weather Report Analysis

This project analyzes weather data using **Pandas** in **Jupyter Notebook** to extract various insights and perform statistical calculations. The dataset provides detailed weather reports, and the analysis includes multiple weather-related metrics.

## 📊 Key Features of the Project:

1. **Weather is Exactly Clear**:
   - Calculated the number of instances where the weather condition is reported as exactly clear.
   
2. **Mean Visibility**:
   - Computed the average visibility across the dataset.

3. **Standard Deviation of Pressure**:
   - Calculated the standard deviation to understand the spread of pressure values.

4. **Variance of Relative Humidity**:
   - Derived the variance to measure how relative humidity varies.

5. **Mean Values Grouped by Weather Condition**:
   - Found the mean of all columns against each unique weather condition.

6. **Minimum & Maximum Values Grouped by Weather Condition**:
   - Identified the minimum and maximum values for all columns, categorized by weather conditions.

7. **Weather Condition is Fog**:
   - Filtered the dataset to show instances where the weather condition is fog.

8. **Weather is Clear and Relative Humidity > 50 or Visibility > 40**:
   - Queried for conditions where the weather is clear and relative humidity exceeds 50 or visibility is above 40.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used:
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas**
- **Python**

## 📂 Dataset:
The dataset used for this project contains detailed weather records, including metrics like temperature, humidity, pressure, and visibility. Each row represents a specific weather report at a given time.

## 🔢 Calculations:
Here are some of the statistical measures computed during the analysis:
- **Mean** of the visibility
- **Standard deviation** of the pressure
- **Variance** of the relative humidity
- **Minimum and Maximum values** for each column based on weather condition
- **Custom filters** for specific weather scenarios

## 📈 Visualizations:
Although this version of the project focuses on statistical calculations, future iterations may include visualizations to present the data more intuitively.
